# Fraction Class

## Overview

The `fraction` class is a Python implementation designed to represent and manipulate mathematical fractions. It provides methods for arithmetic operations, comparisons, and conversions between different representations of fractions. This class ensures that the denominator is never zero and supports simplification of fractions to their lowest terms.

## Features

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Comparisons**: Allows comparison between fractions to determine greater than, less than, or equality.
- **Conversions**: Converts fractions to float and mixed number representations.
- **Simplification**: Automatically simplifies fractions to their lowest terms.
- **Root and Power**: Computes the nth root and raises the fraction to a specified power.

## Installation

To use the `fraction` class, simply copy the code into your Python project. There are no additional dependencies required beyond Python's standard library.

### Creating Fractions

You can create a fraction by instantiating the `fraction` class with a numerator and a denominator:

```python
from type_fraction import fraction

f1 = fraction(4, 16)  # Represents 1/4
f2 = fraction(1, 2)   # Represents 1/2
