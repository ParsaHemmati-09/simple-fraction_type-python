# Overview

The `MixedFraction` class represents a mixed fraction, consisting of a whole number part and a fractional part. This class provides various methods for arithmetic operations, comparisons, and conversions to and from improper fractions.

## Attributes

- **whole_part (int)**: The whole part of the fraction.
- **numerator (int)**: The numerator of the fraction.
- **denominator (int)**: The denominator of the fraction. Must not be zero.

## Methods

### `__init__(numerator, denominator, whole_part)`

Initializes a new instance of the `MixedFraction` class.

- **Parameters**:
  - `numerator`: The numerator of the fractional part.
  - `denominator`: The denominator of the fractional part.
  - `whole_part`: The whole number part of the mixed fraction.

### `__str__()`

Returns the string representation of the mixed fraction in the form `whole_part numerator/denominator`.

### `__add__(other)`

Adds another mixed fraction to this mixed fraction and returns the result.

- **Parameters**:
  - `other`: Another instance of the `MixedFraction` class.
- **Returns**: A new `MixedFraction` instance representing the sum.

### `__sub__(other)`

Subtracts another mixed fraction from this mixed fraction and returns the result.

- **Parameters**:
  - `other`: Another instance of the `MixedFraction` class.
- **Returns**: A new `MixedFraction` instance representing the difference.

### `__mul__(other)`

Multiplies this mixed fraction by another mixed fraction and returns the result.

- **Parameters**:
  - `other`: Another instance of the `MixedFraction` class.
- **Returns**: A new `MixedFraction` instance representing the product.

### `__truediv__(other)`

Divides this mixed fraction by another mixed fraction and returns the result.

- **Parameters**:
  - `other`: Another instance of the `MixedFraction` class.
- **Returns**: A new `MixedFraction` instance representing the quotient.
- **Raises**: ValueError if attempting to divide by zero.

### `__floordiv__(other)`

Floor divides this mixed fraction by another mixed fraction and returns the result.

- **Parameters**:
  - `other`: Another instance of the `MixedFraction` class.
- **Returns**: A new `MixedFraction` instance representing the quotient.
- **Raises**: ValueError if attempting to divide by zero.

### In-place Operations

The following methods provide in-place versions of arithmetic operations:
- **`__iadd__(other)`**: In-place addition with another mixed fraction.
- **`__isub__(other)`**: In-place subtraction with another mixed fraction.
- **`__imul__(other)`**: In-place multiplication with another mixed fraction.
- **`__itruediv__(other)`**: In-place division by another mixed fraction.
- **`__ifloordiv__(other)`**: In-place floor division by another mixed fraction.

### Comparison Methods

The class supports comparison operators:
- **`__gt__(other)`**: Checks if this mixed fraction is greater than another mixed fraction.
- **`__lt__(other)`**: Checks if this mixed fraction is less than another mixed fraction.
- **`__eq__(other)`**: Checks if this mixed fraction is equal to another mixed fraction.
- **`__ge__(other)`**: Checks if this mixed fraction is greater than or equal to another mixed fraction.
- **`__le__(other)`**: Checks if this mixed fraction is less than or equal to another mixed fraction.
- **`__ne__(other)`**: Checks if this mixed fraction is not equal to another mixed fraction.

### `simplify()`

Simplifies the fractional part of this mixed number to its lowest terms.

### `to_float()`

Converts the mixed fraction to a floating-point number representation.

### `to_fraction()`

Converts this mixed fraction to an improper fractional representation.

### Class Method: `float_to_mixed_fraction(fl_x)`

Converts a floating-point number to a new instance of the `MixedFraction`.

- **Parameters**:
  - `fl_x`: The floating-point number to convert.
- **Returns**: A new instance of the `MixedFraction`.
